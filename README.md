# 3d model repo

This repo contains a lot of 3d models made by **me**. The models range from objects, buildings, or simply just geometric animals. If any of the models are not functional, or you think that they are corrupted, please open an issue. 

### Suggesting/contributing

For now, we do not need any other 3d modelers, so the best way(for now) to contribute is by suggesting. Open an issue or a discussion if you have a suggestion. You can suggest anything related to the repository.

If you want me to create a model, simply open an issue or add a discussion. Please include whether you want the model in a specific style as well. 

Please also make sure to star the repo if you like the models! ❤️
